# Probability Distributions
A series of simple analyses on real-world examples of different probability distributions. This mainly covers:
- normal distributions
- geometric distributions
- poisson distributions
- binomial distributions
- t-distributions

Each example looks at the density function (prefix `d`), distribution function (prefix `p`), quantile function (prefix `q`) and random generation (prefix `r`) for the distribution.
