# Website Visits 
For the purposes of this experiment, let's say a website gets 4 visits per minute on average.

**What's the probability of getting 6 page views in one minute?**
```{r}
dpois(6, lambda = 4)
```

**What's the probability of getting 8 of fewer?**
```{r}
ppois(8, lambda = 4, lower.tail = TRUE)
```

**How many page views occur at the 90th percentile?**
```{r}
qpois(.90, lambda = 4)
```

**Simulate 10 hours worth of page views**
```{r}
set.seed(42)
simulated_visits <- rpois(6000, lambda)

# visualizing simulated Poisson distribution
df_visits <- data.frame(Visits = simulated_visits)

ggplot(df_visits, aes(x = Visits)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, fill = "lightblue", color = "black") +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Poisson Distribution: Website Visits per Minute", x = "Visits", y = "Frequency")
```
