## Experiments
Set probability
p <- 0.63 

**What is the probability that they make their first shot on the 3rd attempt?**
```{r}
# probability of first success on 3rd shot
dgeom(3, prob = p)
```

**What is the probability that they make at least 3 attempts before scoring?**
```{r}
pgeom(3, prob = p, lower.tail = TRUE)
```

**Simulate 1000 shooting sequences.**
```{r}
simulated_shots <- rgeom(1000, prob = p)

# Convert to dataframe
df_shots <- data.frame(Attempts = simulated_shots)

# plot histogram
ggplot(df_shots, aes(x = Attempts)) +
  geom_bar(fill = "lightcoral", color = "black") +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Simulated Free-Throw Attempts Until First Make",
       x = "Attempts Until First Success",
       y = "Frequency")
```
