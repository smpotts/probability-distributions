# Birthday Paradox
The problem asks:
"What is the probability that at least two people in a group of 𝑛 have the same birthday?"

With 23 people, the probability is ≈ 50.7%.
With 50 people, the probability is ≈ 97%.
With 70 people, it's >99.9%.

### Load libraries
library(ggplot2)

## Experiments
**Compute at least one shared birthday for different group sizes.**
```{r}
# function to calculate probability of at least one shared birthday
birthday_prob <- function(n) {
  prob_unique <- 1  # start with 100% unique birthdays
  for (i in 1:(n-1)) {
    prob_unique <- prob_unique * (365 - i) / 365
  }
  return(1 - prob_unique)  # complement rule
}

# compute probabilities for group sizes 1 to 50
group_sizes <- 1:50
probs <- sapply(group_sizes, birthday_prob)
probs

# convert to data frame for plotting
df_birthday <- data.frame(GroupSize = group_sizes, Probability = probs)

# plotting probabilities
ggplot(df_birthday, aes(x = GroupSize, y = Probability)) +
  geom_line(color = "blue", size = 1.2) +
  geom_point(color = "red") +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Birthday Paradox Probability Curve",
       x = "Number of People in Room",
       y = "Probability of Shared Birthday") +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format())
