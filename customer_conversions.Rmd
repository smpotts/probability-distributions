# Customer Conversions
A company sends out 500 promotional emails. The probability of a response is 2%.

### Load libraries
library(ggplot2)

## Experiments
**What is the probability of at least 15 responses?**
```{r}
pbinom(15, size = 500, prob = 0.02, lower.tail = FALSE)
```

**What does the distribution look like if we simulate 500 trials?**
```{r}
simulated_responses <- rbinom(500, size = 500, prob = 0.02)

# convert to dataframe
df_responses <- data.frame(Responses = simulated_responses)
summary(df_responses)

# histogram
ggplot(df_responses, aes(x = Responses)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 2, fill = "lightcoral", color = "black") +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Customer Responses in 500 Simulations",
       x = "Number of Responses",
       y = "Frequency")
```
