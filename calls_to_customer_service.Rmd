# Calls to a Customer Service Center
A call center receives an average of 12 calls per hour.

**Probability of getting exactly 10 calls in an hour**
```{r}
# lambda is our sample mean
lambda <- 12

dpois(10, lambda = lambda)
```

**Probability of getting 15 calls or fewer in an hour**
```{r}
ppois(15, lambda, lower.tail = TRUE)
```

**What is the number of calls received at the 95th percentile?**
```{r}
qpois(0.95, lambda = lambda)
```

**Simulate 1000 hours and visualize the distribution**
```{r}
set.seed(29)
# simulate 1000 hours
sample <- rpois(1000, lambda = lambda)

# visualizing simulated Poisson distribution
library(ggplot2)
df_calls <- data.frame(Calls = sample)

# create a histogram visualizing the frequencies
ggplot(df_calls, aes(x = Calls)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, fill = "lightblue", color = "black") +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Poisson Distribution: Calls per Hour", x = "Calls", y = "Frequency")
```
